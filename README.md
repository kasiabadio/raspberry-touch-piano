# raspberry-touch-piano
## General info
The goal of a project was to create a two octave touch piano, where user can freeplay, can learn a new song by touching keys, which were lighted in a specific order and can ask a device to play selected song, which was earlier saved in a database. A person can navigate between menu's options by clicking up and down buttons near the lcd screen and click OK. Sound is played by the buzzer.
